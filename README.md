PHP-Simple-Image-Upload
=======================

A barebones one page app to create/delete 'sets' for images and upload/delete images to those sets.

- It is username/password protected (http digest authentication).
- There is only one line of CSS styling.
- No database is used.

I cut and pasted code from all over tidied it up, added a load... Enjoy
